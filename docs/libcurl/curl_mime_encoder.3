.TH curl_mime_encoder 3 "22 August 2017" "libcurl 7.56.0" "libcurl Manual"
.SH NAME
curl_mime_encoder - set a mime part's encoder and content transfer encoding
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <curl/curl.h>
.sp
.BI "CURLcode curl_mime_encoder(curl_mimepart * " part ,
.BI "curlencoding " encoding ");"
.ad
.SH DESCRIPTION
curl_mime_encoder() requests a mime part's body to be encoded before being
transmitted. Currently not supported.

\fIpart\fP is the part's handle to assign an encoder.
\fIencoding\fP is a encoding token. It may be set to CURLENCODING_NONE to
disable an encoder previously attached to the part.
NULL to remove a previously attached remote file name.

Setting a part's encoder twice is valid: only the value set by the last call is
retained.
.SH RETURN VALUE
CURLE_OK or a CURL error code upon failure.

.SH "SEE ALSO"
