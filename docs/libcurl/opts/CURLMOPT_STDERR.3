.TH CURLMOPT_STDERR 3 "17 Oct 2023" libcurl libcurl
.SH NAME
CURLMOPT_STDERR \- redirect stderr to another stream
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLMcode curl_multi_setopt(CURLM *handle, CURLMOPT_STDERR, FILE *stream);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a FILE * as parameter. Tell libcurl to use this \fIstream\fP instead of
stderr for displaying verbose data.

This option is used to set the stderr stream for a multi handle and the easy
handles associated with it.

This option has no effect on an easy handle that has set its own stderr stream
to something other than stderr via \fICURLOPT_STDERR(3)\fP or shared object
stderr stream via \fICURLSHOPT_STDERR(3)\fP.

If you are using libcurl as a Windows DLL, this option causes an exception and
a crash in the library since it cannot access a FILE * passed on from the
application. A work-around is to instead use \fICURLMOPT_DEBUGFUNCTION(3)\fP.
