.TH CURLOPT_AUTOREFERER 3 "17 Jun 2014" "libcurl 7.37.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"
.SH NAME
CURLOPT_AUTOREFERER \- automatically update the referer header
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_AUTOREFERER, long autorefer);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a long parameter set to 1 to enable automatic referer headers. When
enabled, libcurl will automatically set the Referer: header field in HTTP
requests to the full URL where it follows a Location: redirect.

Starting in curl 7.87.0: setting the value to 1 will make libcurl use
\fIorigin-only mode\fP, where it only sets the "origin" in the header. That
means scheme, host name and port number. Set the value to 2 to make libcurl
also include the path and query parts in the \fBReferer:\fP header. Before
7.87.0, libcurl would also act as if 2 was set.
.SH DEFAULT
0, disabled
.SH PROTOCOLS
HTTP
.SH EXAMPLE

if(curl) {
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com/foo.bin");

  /* set Referer: automatically when following redirects */
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_AUTOREFERER, 1L);

  ret = curl_easy_perform(curl);

  curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
}
.fi
