.TH curl_multi_init_advanced 3 "21 January 2020" "libcurl 7.69.0" "libcurl Manual"
.SH NAME
curl_multi_init_advanced - create a multi handle with advanced init options
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <curl/curl.h>
.sp
.BI "CURLM *curl_multi_init_advanced(int " flags ", ... );"
.ad
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function returns a CURLM handle to be used as input to all the other
multi-functions, sometimes referred to as a multi handle in some places in the
documentation. This init call MUST have a corresponding call to
\fIcurl_multi_cleanup(3)\fP when the operation is complete.

\fBflags\fP refer to the FLAGS section below.

\fIcurl_multi_init(3)\fP is the same as this function except that it doesn't
allow setting advanced init options.
.SH FLAGS
.IP CURL_MULTI_DISABLE_POLL_WAKEUP
Since 7.68.0 each multi has a wakeup socket pair to allow waking
\fIcurl_multi_poll(3)\fP from a different thread. The wakeup socket pair is 2
sockets that remain open for the life of the multi. If your socket resources
are very limited you can use this flag to disable the wakeup socket pair. Note
\fIcurl_multi_wakeup(3)\fP will return an error if there is no wakeup socket
pair.
.IP CURL_MULTI_EXTENDED_INIT_OPTIONS
(Reserved) If this flag is used then there is a second argument that is a
pointer to a variable-length struct with extended initialization options.
.SH AVAILABILITY
7.69.0
.SH RETURN VALUE
If this function returns NULL, something went wrong and you cannot use the
other curl functions.
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
CURLM *multi = curl_multi_init_advanced(CURL_MULTI_DISABLE_POLL_WAKEUP);
.fi
