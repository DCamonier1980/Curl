// this is getting called after the connection is established,

// otherwise it just tries to connect to a host based on the CID

/*

I've been reading the codebase and I am starting to see why this is hard. It seems 
that by the time any of the protocol handlers are called, the DNS lookup has already been performed. 
Or at least that changing the hostname in the setup_connection handler doesn't not have an
effect on the behavior.

Does it make sense to add a new callback to the Curl_handler that can be called for each data URL, 
maybe from something like parseurlandfillconn?

Are there any more resources to help me understand the control flow?
